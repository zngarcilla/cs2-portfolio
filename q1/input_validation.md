# Input Validation and Output Verification
**Activity:** PSHS Workshop Registration Validator

## Activity Overview
In this activity, I created a program that validates information entered into a PSHS workshop registration
system.
The program checks whether user input satisfies specific requirements before accepting the registration.
The program validates:
- student name
- age
- grade level
- email address and
- registration code.

# Part A - Validation Requirements

| Data Captured | Expected Input | Validation Type | Invalid Input Example | Validation Rule | Error |Message |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|----|
| Student Name | Zoe Arcilla | | | | |
| Age | 13 | | | | |
| Grade Level | 8 | | | | |
| Email Address | zngarcilla@brc.pshs.edu.ph | | | | |
| Registration Code | 263667 | | | | |

## Validation Questions
### 1. Why should the student name not be blank?
> Write your answer here.
### 2. Why should age be checked for both data type and range?
> Write your answer here.
### 3. Why should grade level only accept specific values?
> Write your answer here.
### 4. What format requirements did you use for the email address?
> Write your answer here.
### 5. What length requirement did you use for the registration code?
> Write your answer here.

# Part B - Program Design
Before writing your program, create either a **flowchart or pseudocode** showing its logic.
## Flowchart
Insert your flowchart below.
![Workshop Validator Flowchart](workshop_validator_flowchart.png)
OR
## Pseudocode

```text
START
Write your pseudocode here.
END
```

Your design should show:
- user input
- validation decisions
- error messages
- accepted registration
- rejected registration.

# Part D - Testing
Test your program using both valid and invalid inputs.
| Test | Input / Condition | Validation Being Tested | Expected Output | Actual Output | Result |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | All inputs valid | Normal case | | | |
| 2 | Blank student name | Presence | | | |
| 3 | Age = `fourteen` | Data type | | | |
| 4 | Age = `11` | Minimum boundary | | | |
| 5 | Age = `18` | Maximum boundary | | | |
| 6 | Age = `10` | Range | | | |
| 7 | Grade Level = `13` | Acceptable value | | | |
| 8 | Email = `studentpshs.edu.ph` | Pattern | | | |
| 9 | Registration Code = `ABC` | Length | | | |
| 10 | Registration Code = `CS2026` | Valid length | | | |
Write **PASS** when the actual output matches the expected output.
Write **FAIL** when it does not.
