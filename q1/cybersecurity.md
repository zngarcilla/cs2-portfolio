## Activity Overview 
In this activity, I analyzed a cybersecurity threat and developed secure data-capture rules for a simple PSHS Club Registration System. 
The goal is to create a program that collects only necessary information and accepts only correct, expected, and appropriate input.

# Part B - Data Privacy and Secure Data Capture 
A proposed Club Registration System wants to collect the following information. Determine whether each item is really necessary. 
| Data | Collect / Do Not Collect | Reason | 
|---|---|---| 
| Student Name | | | 
| Section | | | 
| Club Choice | | | 
| School Email | | | 
| Attendance Status | | | 
| Password | | | 
| OTP | | | 
| Home Address | | |
| Parent Bank Account | | |

## Privacy Question 
Why is it safer to collect only information that the program actually needs? > Write your answer here.

# Part C - Security-Focused Validation Rules 
Complete the table before writing your program. 
| Data Captured | Expected Input | Possible Risk | Invalid Input Example | Validation Rule | Error Message | 
|---|---|---|---|---|---| 
| Student Name | | | | | | 
| Section | | | | | | 
| Club Choice | | | | | | 
| School Email | | | | | | 
| Attendance Status | | | | | | 
--- 
## Secure Data Capture Questions 
### 1. What should your program accept? 
> Write your answer here. 
### 2. What should your program reject? 
> Write your answer here. 
### 3. How do your validation rules help reduce incorrect or unsafe input? > Write your answer here. 
--- 
# Part D - Secure Program Implementation 
## Program 
Create a simple **PSHS Club Registration System**. 
The program should collect only: 
- Student Name 
- Section 
- Club Choice 
- School Email
- Attendance Status 
It should **not request passwords, OTPs, banking information, or unnecessary personal information**. 
--- 
## Source Code File 
[`secure_registration.py`](secure_registration.py) 
--- 
## Final Code 
```python 
# Paste your final program here. 
``` 
--- 
## Security Practices Applied 
### Required Input 
> Explain how you handled blank input. 
### Allowed Values 
> Explain which fields accept only predefined values. 
### Format Check 
> Explain your simple email validation rule. 
### Error Messages 
> Explain why clear error messages are useful. 
### Data Minimization 
> Explain what information you intentionally did NOT collect and why.

# Part E - Testing and Reflection 
## Testing 
| Test | Input Situation | Expected Output | Actual Output | Result | 
|---:|---|---|---|---| 
| 1 | All data valid | | | | 
| 2 | Blank student name | | | | 
| 3 | Invalid section | | | |
| 4 | Invalid club choice | | | | 
| 5 | Email missing `@` | | | | 
| 6 | Email missing `.` | | | | 
| 7 | Invalid attendance status | | | | 
| 8 | Different valid inputs | | | | 
Use: 
- **PASS** if the actual result matches the expected result. 
- **FAIL** if it does not.

# Reflection 
### 1. What is one cybersecurity threat that can affect an application or user? > Write your answer here. 
### 2. How can users reduce the risk of phishing or suspicious messages? > Write your answer here. 
### 3. How can validation rules improve the security of user input? > Write your answer here. 
### 4. Why should a program avoid collecting unnecessary personal information? > Write your answer here. 
### 5. How did SG7's input validation concepts become security practices in SG8? > Write your answer here.
